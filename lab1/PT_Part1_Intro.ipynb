        "In training neural networks, we use differentiation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize a loss function. Now that we have a sense of how PyTorch's autograd can be used to compute and access derivatives, we will look at an example where we use automatic differentiation and SGD to find the minimum of $ L=(x-x_f)^2 $. Here $x_f$ is a variable for a desired value we are trying to optimize for; $L$ represents a loss that we are trying to minimize. While we can clearly solve this problem analytically ($ x_{min}=x_f $), considering how we can compute this using PyTorch's autograd sets us up nicely for future labs where we use gradient descent to optimize entire neural network losses."
